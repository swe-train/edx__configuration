Description
***********

A collection of configuration scripts using Ansible for deploying edx.org.
This is not meant for general Open edX deployment and use. View the

What is in this Repo?
*********************

* `playbooks </playbooks>`__: This directory contains ansible playbooks that can
  be used to configure individual services in the openedx platform. See
  `Open EdX Installation options`_ before trying to use any of the scripts in
  this directory.
* `docker </docker>`__: This directory contains dockerfiles that can be used to
  test that playbooks execute cleanly.  See `Makefiles <Makefiles.rst>`__ for
  Documentation on how to run these containers.
* `requirements </requirements>`__ : inputs for `pip-compile <https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools>`__
  Update files in this directory and then run ``make upgrade`` to update
  ``requirements.txt``
* `tests </tests>`__: scripts used by travis-ci to test changes to this repo
* `util </util>`__: one-off scripts or tools used to perform certain functions
  related to openedx management.
* `vagrant </vagrant>`__: vagrant tooling for testing changes to this repo.


Roadmap
*******

This repository is in ``sustained`` status.  The goal is to deprecate this codebase
and move the deployment code into the repos with the application code.

With the adoption of containerized application platforms like `Kubernetes
<https://kubernetes.io/>`__, the tools in this repository are complex
and inappropriate for building small single purpose containers.

At edx.org, we are focusing on deployment of applications using `Terraform
<https://www.terraform.io/>`__ and `Kubernetes <https://kubernetes.io/>`__.  We
hope to provide open source tooling for this soon.
